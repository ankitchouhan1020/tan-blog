The cobwebs were pretty gargantuan and widespread all over the room. One cupboard was broken, another had an entire panel missing and the third was locked with no key to be found. The bed base was simply an old plank of plywood, a tad smaller than the bed size, which I had serious doubt about whether it would hold up if I sleep over it. Simply put, the room was in shambles. This was going to be my first-year hostel room (H1 – 1004). **I distinctly remember having just eye-contacts with my Baba from time to time, not saying anything but still our faces saying it all.** The same thing was going on between my roommate and his dad. Lets just not talk about the conditions of the toilets at that time. This was probably the first regret (although misplaced), more so for my father than to me in this college. Did I just study my ass off for 2 years with minimal to null social life to live in this clutter? But **now being in my final semester all I can say is – life in these very hostels was one of the most sublime yet chaotic times of my college life.**

In my experience people generally never actually regret anything during their school time. They only perceive something as regret and later in their lives probably even forget about it. It is only starting from your college years when you are actually independent and fully responsible for your actions that the element of regret may actually come in.

**Regret** at its most basic understanding is a negative emotion over an action you did or did not do in the past in whose doing or not doing you would be in a more perceived favorable or desirable scenario today. It brings with it the constant urge to do actions or inactions to right the wrong you did in the past so that your current path merges with the now desirable path you missed out on earlier. And when it is impossible to retrieve what might have been (which is almost most of the time), it gnaws our mind and soul perpetually whenever we sense something which reminds us of it. Thus in its worst form regrets are detrimental to our development and success. In an effort to gain back what is lost, may it be an opportunity, a promotion, a job, a good friend, a loved one or confidence to do the right thing, we tend to jeopardize what we now have. The worst-case scenario is when we give it our all and still are unable to get back what we had, losing all we have in the present for it, which leads to the regret of having regret. This in turn just develops into an endless wheel of self-inflicted suffering akin to Dante’s circles of hell.

So now the question arises what do we do then? Do we just never have any regrets? Or do we give up all the hope of that better future we might have had just because we messed up that one time? Perhaps we should avoid choices than because apparently choices later cause regret, right? WRONG! There is not a single adult person alive right now who does not have any regret in his/her life. **If someone says to you that they are living the best possible version of their life without a single regret, they are simply lying.** So how do we tackle this daunting yet marvelous enigma? I will come back to this later on.

For now, let’s just go back to college. The number of regrets a person has in his 4 years (only for the engineering, of course) of the college is probably far more, frequency wise, then in the latter part of his life. Up until this point we have been living in the world our parents created for us but college life is a tutorial for living in the real world. This is where we are sure to fall and have to get up on our own (with luckily some help most of the time) tending to our own wounds and continue doing the best we can with what little we have bearing all the pain along with it all.**And damn the pain is real.** On the brighter side though, it also comes with a fair share of happiness, freedom to do what we love and some gem people with whom you can relate to. We are what we want to be here. No one can tell us to be otherwise. In my 3.77 years of college, I have had a few regrets too just like every other Tom, Dick, and Harry around me. **In preparation for writing this article, I asked around my fellow friends and peers as to what are their regrets in college. I will note the most prevalent and relevant ones among them and give my take on what one could do about them.**

### The ones regretting not being part of any societies in college...
This reminds me of that one night I was in my hostel room alone in my 4th semester, seeing my friends’ Instagram stories about their year-end society parties. At that moment I indeed felt a little left out as I am not in one(I am in Quiz Club Manit, but it is a Hobbyist club). This got me pondering. What am I actually missing? What did my fellow society peers gain from it? Turns out, I was not missing out on a lot. The only major things that I find worthy of being in any society are the opportunities to socialize and form connections with your peers, juniors and seniors and the occasional parties that come with it. Apart from that maybe you learn a little managerial skill and in general how to deal with people. But that’s not something you cannot learn easily yourselves if you haven’t already by living in hostels. My advice is that just keep in touch and have good relations with some good seniors in your college from the beginning. That would suffice just enough. And coming to the parties, man/woman just ask your peers/seniors for one. There’s always a reason for one.

### The ones wasting their time instead of utilizing it towards something productive and later on regretting it...
Apart from very few extremely focused people, all of us have wasted time in college and might I dare say continue to do so, being very well aware at the back of our minds that we can utilize this time for something productive. The thing is after all the efforts we had given to reach college, a sense of freedom and satisfaction engulfs us when we finally are here. Studying becomes the least of our concerns then. And you know what, that is actually fine. In my experience, you can focus on things other than your studies till at most the end of 2nd year even if those things would necessarily be deleterious to you. Just try to have as much experience of as many things as you can because this is the only time when you can do a plethora of crazy things with not so major backlashes. If you still think that you wasted a lot of time when you are in your final year, just get serious and start focusing again. It would only take more time than others but you would reach success eventually just as some of your peers.

### The ones who regret trusting and giving importance to someone who in the end was not worthy of it at all...
A failed friendship or relationship can often set in motion an avalanche effect leading to the circle of regrets as mentioned earlier. It changes a human being. It becomes hard to trust again easily and even if we want to we do not because we just get mentally drained by the thought of giving them time and love to someone again. It becomes difficult to put your belief in someone when the past shows evidence that you shouldn’t. What people do not realize is that all this simply means you are still letting the person that disappointed you influence your life. Yes, be wary. Do not open up to new people quickly. But if you find someone who you think is worthy of your time do not be afraid to dive in. You are more mature now then you were earlier. My best advice would be that try to not have many expectations from anyone. You have to learn to love yourself and be self-sufficient.

### The ones who regret losing their friends and/or lovers...
Tempers flared, hurtful things were said and bang, the next thing you sense is this huge void which suddenly engulfs your life. You realize at that moment how important the other person truly was for you. Every day feels like an eternity and every night you cry yourself to sleep. It doesn’t matter whose fault it was at this point, the damage has been done, irreversibly so. What to do now? Let things cool down first. Time is your ally. Purge your frustrations but take care not to go on badmouthing the person all over the place. Limit your diatribe to just one person you can confide in and trust. Do not be afraid to try to reach out first. When attempting reconciliation, both your egos are just additional obstacles both of you have to bore through to make meaningful communication between your pure selves. Apologize for your part and try to talk it all out. If it does work out, well and good otherwise just give the other person space. If they truly were your friend/lover they will come back in your life at some point in the future but do not halt your life for them. Also do not lose your self-respect in the process. No one is worth losing your dignity over. Truth be told, nobody remains on good terms with every friend they made in the first year when they reach their final year.

### The ones who regret being single...
College is rife with opportunities for romance. Even if you are dumb enough not to recognize them, your fellow peers would take care of that for you. There is a sense of comfort in knowing there is always someone to hear you out, share things with, shower you with love and surprises and just be there for you even when you are at fault. In this tumultuous period having that person who brings serenity and a sense of belonging to your soul and body is a stupendous and euphoric feeling indeed. But even if you do not get into a relationship, it’s nowhere near the end of the world. It looks really sweet and easy from the outside but committing to someone is a thing of great responsibility. Being in a relationship because you succumbed to the peer pressure which made you feel bad for being single, were feeling lonely as all your friends were committed, just to create an image among your peers, to be part of the ‘cool’ kids or to just satisfy your physical needs are all the prerequisite steps needed for heartbreaks and scarred souls. Date a lot (cannot emphasize this enough) but do not commit until you are sure of it. At the end of the day, it’s not about the kissing, holding hands, the dates and the sex but rather about being with someone who makes you happy in a way that no one else can. It’s about being with someone who accepts you and your weirdness. It’s about being yourself around them and being themselves around you.

### So...
Now finally coming back to our marvelous enigma of how to deal with regret: it’s actually really simple. All we need to do is to start perceiving the negative emotion, that regret is, to a motivational one instead. Why should we yearn for the path which we do not have any power over anymore? It’s simply stupid. What makes you believe for sure that a much better path is not lying in your future? Regrets are just another facet of failures. And what do we know about failures? The more you fail, the more you learn and the more you succeed eventually. Take your regrets as learning and the next time you are in a similar situation where your life branches out you know which branch to choose. Now if anyone says to you that they have no regrets in their lives, it just means that their comprehension of regret is different from the generic one because they merely possess the uncommonly found common sense in them.
